## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Svelte framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was a real challenge, with it I understood the structure of Svelte better and used most of the basic and more advanced concepts of the framework, reactivity, data fetching, routing and much more.

It is worth taking into account that I am used to developing using React and Next.js and starting to code with a new structure and in fact different from the React standard established on the web is a certain challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)
- [SvelteKit Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction)

The Svelte documentation was my faithful ally in this challenge.
